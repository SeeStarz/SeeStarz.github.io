          <h3>C++</h3>
          <p>C++ is a language of mystery.
            There are a lot of obsecure features, undefined behaviours,
            dangling pointers, and generally a realm of the unknowns.
            I however am confident in understanding most of the foundations.
            My biggest project yet, Sovereign Chess, is coded in full C++</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>SFML</h3>
          <p>SFML, short for Simple Fast Multimedia Library,
            is like it's name a library to deal with various medias.
            I used this library in my project as a way to make windows,
            viewports, image rendering, audio effects, and networking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>Python is where my journey starts to first flourish.
            At first i only tinkered around with C++ and Java but didn't get far.
            After some guided sessions about python and some bunch of small tinkering porjects,
            everything starts to make sense. Though there are countless python libraries,
            I am confident in my python fundamentals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>Pygame</h3>
          <p>Pygame is the library in which i made small games in python.
            It has more support on layering things on top of each other
            compared to SFML, but it is pretty similar.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>Java is where my journey first started.
            I do however got stuck on classes the first time around.
            Although I still haven't really learned java in it's entirety,
            I am able to make some minecraft mods which is written on Java.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>Minecraft Modding</h3>
          <p>At a certain point, I learned to make minecraft mods.
            I digged my way to find out that there really are some
            obsecure requirements that looks weird but that is how it's done,
            and quite a bunch of hardcoded values in place.
            It was very interesting to work with a huge codebase,
            but I do prefer understanding what I am doing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>Linux</h3>
          <p>I use arch btw. Need I say more? Anyways I started
            using arch a few months before my national exam announcment.
            Having partitioned, installed, and configuring my system with
            the help of the arch wiki I learned a lot of new things.
            For example the UEFI booting system has it's own EFI partition
            that contains programs that points to other programs in other partition.
            How the package manager handles dependencies in linux is vastly different
            than how it works in windows, it's way more transparent in saying
            what should and shouldn't conflict with each other.

          <h3>Terminal</h3>
          <p>I just love working in the terminal.
            Okay not the tty, that is pretty boring, although usable.
            Terminal emulators though, it can display pretty colors and symbols
            while still being keyboard oriented.
            I'm not saying I know and are good with every single cli tools,
            but I very much like them.
            Git, gio, magick, gifsickle, ffmpeg, unison, pacman, yay, pipx, qpdf, and others.
            These cli tools has the advantage that it is easily automatable.
            Tui apps are also very cool, like nvim, nchat, tiptop, and so on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Box">
          <h3>Typing</h3>
          <p> Using the colemak layout I clocked in at average 100 wpm on typeracer.
            With the qwerty layout around 80wpm which is still good,
            but I don't like typing in qwerty.
            Using keyboard instead of mouse is beneficial.
            No need to change focus to aim and click at something, just press some keys.
            The difference might be only half a second but the interruption
            will slow down the train of thought.
            Also using mostly keyboard eliminates the need of a mouse,
            making it much more comfortable to work anywhere.
            I used neovim as my main code editor and used hyprland as my main compositor.
            Both of these provide a very quick shortcut to minimize delay and focus on action.

            <h3>Sovereign Chess</h3>
            <img src="asset/chess.png" height=200>
            <p>This is a desktop game made in C++ with SFML library for the chess variant
              "Sovereign Chess" by Mark Bates.
              My biggest and proudest project so far.
              All of the logic are written by me in C++, complete with
              it's own button event system.
              The only library used is SFML to deal with graphics,
              audio, windowing, user input, and TCP requests.
              This project taught me a lot about C++ and it's dangling pointers.
              Once i was stuck for hours debugging just to realize that
              extending a vector changes it's location in memory,
              rendering all pointers to it's members dangling.
              This project also taught me about C++'s build system.
              And yes, it is a big mess.
              I used vscode's manual compile script at the beginning and later
              created my own script for MinGW Make and GnuMake.
              By adding linux ports I also have a bit more awareness
              about the different build systems there is.
              And the fact that different compilers really don't
              want to agree on some things sometimes.</p>

            <h3>Minecraft Mods</h3>
            <img src="asset/netherite_bow.png" height=200>
            <p>I published two minecraft mods.
              Strong Netherite Bow Mod,
              a minecraft mod adding a new bow made of netherite that is stronger,
              but also unique by prolonging it's charge duration.
              Originally meant for elytra fights midair.
              All stats are configurable via a config file.
              The bow mod is then complemented by Fast Projectile Fix Mod to fix rendering issue.
              Both mods are developed for Minecraft forge version 1.16.5.
              How the mod is created is pretty straight forward,
              by following some youtube tutorial and mimicking some of
              Minecraft's original code, it is possible to add a completely
              new bow that's compatible with the original.
              There are some areas of code that doesn't make sense why it is,
              but that is how it works.
              There are also some areas where it's needed to hook with
              Minecraft's event handling system, notably the FOV change.
              Lastly any projectile above a certain speed will render absolutely incorrect,
              despite having a correct trajectory and destination.
              This happened due to Minecraft clamping values between -4 and 4.
              To fix this Fast Projectile Fix was deployed separately to override
              these mechanics and instead send a proper double type value.
