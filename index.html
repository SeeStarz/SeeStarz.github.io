    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <section class="Skills">
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>C++</h3>
        <p>C++ is a language of mystery.
          There are a lot of obsecure features, undefined behaviours,
          dangling pointers, and generally a realm of the unknowns.
          I however am confident in understanding most of the foundations.
          My biggest project yet, Sovereign Chess, is coded in full C++</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>SFML</h3>
        <p>SFML, short for Simple Fast Multimedia Library,
          is like it's name a library to deal with various medias.
          I used this library in my project as a way to make windows,
          viewports, image rendering, audio effects, and networking.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python is where my journey starts to first flourish.
          At first i only tinkered around with C++ and Java but didn't get far.
          After some guided sessions about python and some bunch of small tinkering porjects,
          everything starts to make sense. Though there are countless python libraries,
          I am confident in my python fundamentals at the very least.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Pygame</h3>
        <p>Pygame is the library in which i made small games in python.
          It has more support on layering things on top of each other
          compared to SFML, but it is pretty similar.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java is where my journey first started.
          I do however got stuck on classes the first time around.
          Although I still haven't really learned java in it's entirety,
          I am able to make some minecraft mods which is written on Java.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Minecraft Modding</h3>
        <p>At a certain point, I learned to make minecraft mods.
          I digged my way to find out that there really are some
          obsecure requirements that looks weird but that is how it's done,
          and quite a bunch of hardcoded values in place.
          It was very interesting to work with a huge codebase,
          but I do prefer understanding what I am doing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>I use arch btw. Need I say more? Anyways I started
          using arch a few months before my national exam announcment.
          Having partitioned, installed, and configuring my system with
          the help of the arch wiki I learned a lot of new things.
          For example the UEFI booting system has it's own EFI partition
          that contains programs that points to other programs in other partition.
          How the package manager handles dependencies in linux is vastly different
          than how it works in windows, it's way more transparent in saying
          what should and shouldn't conflict with each other.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Terminal</h3>
        <p>I just love working in the terminal.
          Okay not the tty, that is pretty boring, although usable.
          Terminal emulators though, it can display pretty colors and symbols
          while still being keyboard oriented.
          I'm not saying I know and are good with every single cli tools,
          but I very much like them.
          Git, gio, magick, gifsickle, ffmpeg, unison, pacman, yay, pipx, qpdf, and others.
          These cli tools has the advantage that it is easily automatable.
          Tui apps are also very cool, like nvim, nchat, tiptop, and so on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Box">
        <h3>Typing</h3>
        <p> Using the colemak layout I clocked in at average 100 wpm on typeracer.
          With the qwerty layout around 80wpm which is still good,
          but I don't like typing in qwerty.
          Using keyboard instead of mouse is beneficial.
          No need to change focus to aim and click at something, just press some keys.
          The difference might be only half a second but the interruption
          will slow down the train of thought.
          Also using mostly keyboard eliminates the need of a mouse,
          making it much more comfortable to work anywhere.
          I used neovim as my main code editor and used hyprland as my main compositor.
          Both of these provide a very quick shortcut to minimize delay and focus on action.
